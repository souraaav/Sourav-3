      <p>
        Today is all about you. Your smile, your kindness, your soul â€” they light up the world more than you know. I made this just for you, to remind you that you're one in a million. No code, no design, no universe could ever capture what you mean to me â€” but I tried anyway ðŸ’«.

      <p>
        Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to many more together.
      </p>
      <p>Forever Yours, <br><strong>Sourav</strong> ðŸ’Œ</p>
